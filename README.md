# Project: Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4 Game Strategies

## Video Demo

A video demonstrating the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WsBADKmYUQlIH3RuweLyHEijf4wFn-Ur/view?usp=sharing). The video showcases the gameplay and strategies implemented in the project.

## Project Files and Functions

The project consists of several Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing different game strategies for Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. The following files are included:

### 1. Tic_Tac_Toe_MinMax.ipynb

This file contains a class that implements Tic Tac Toe using the Minimax algorithm. It provides multiple blocks with different depths and players. To control the depth of the Minimax algorithm, set the `i` variable to 0.

### 2. Tic_Tac_Toe_QL.ipynb

In this file, you will find a class that implements Tic Tac Toe using Q-learning. The `run` function takes the game parameter and the `j` variable (0 or 1) to determine who plays first.

### 3. Connect4_MinMax.ipynb

The `Connect4_MinMax.ipynb` file includes a class that implements Connect 4 using the Minimax algorithm. Use the `run` function to play the game. It takes the following parameters:
- `j`: Specifies who plays first (0 or 1)
- `depth`: Sets the depth of the Minimax algorithm
- `itera`: Specifies the total number of games to be played

### 4. Connect4_QL.ipynb

This file contains the implementation of Q-learning for Connect 4. The `run` function executes the code, while the other functions are helper functions. Use the following parameters:
- `j`: Specifies who plays first
- `itera`: Specifies the total number of episodes to run

### 5. Tic_Tac_Toe_MinMaxvsQL.ipynb

The `Tic_Tac_Toe_MinMaxvsQL.ipynb` file allows you to compare the Minimax algorithm against Q-learning in Tic Tac Toe. The `run` function runs the program and accepts the following parameters:
- `jj`: Specifies who plays first
- `itera`: Specifies the total number of games played
- `ddd`: Sets the depth of the Minimax algorithm
- `display`: Set to 1 to display additional results

### 6. Connect4_MinMaxvsQl.ipynb

In this file, you can compare the Minimax algorithm against Q-learning in Connect 4. The `run` function accepts the following parameters:
- `j`: Specifies who plays first
- `itera`: Specifies the total number of games played

## How to Run

To run the code in these notebooks, open them in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells. The output and results are already present in the notebooks for reference. Feel free to modify the parameters to experiment with different scenarios.
